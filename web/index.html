        Software engineer and freelancer. In love with the craft.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        In the summer of 2015 I wrote my first program (a Windows Forms app
        written in VB.NET, believe it or not). Over the course of that fateful
        summer I quickly became so deeply enamored with programming that I made
        it my profession.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        Since then I've successfully attained two higher education degrees in
        computing, lived in two countries, became a freelancer and open source
        contributor, created and maintained a microservice application with over
        seventy thousand lines of code all by myself, programmed supercomputers
        including a neuromorphic one with over one million cores (SpiNNaker),
        tried to teach machines how to see and how to conservatively predict
        whether a loan request is likely to default, learned a lot, failed many
        times and had the time of my life doing it all.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        This wesite serves as an introduction to myself, my work and the values
        it embodies.

        ambitions, don't hesitate to

        Software engineering is an idealistic endeavor.
        I became a freelancer, partly because I didn't want to compromise on
        what I think software should be.
        To create synergies and subsequently an environment that fosters
        collaboration and creativity, core values must match.

          Not only to prevent security issues, but also from the standpoint of
          cost.

          Software engineering has a lot to do with gut feeling.
          Sometimes you find ideas along the way that feel like they have the
          potential of creating something amazing.
          Instead of rigidly focusing on the backlog, I believe these ideas
          have to be explored immediately.

          Deleting code is better than writing it.

          to my work.
          My focus lies on creating lean, extensible, decoupled and long-living
          software.
          If I think a feature does not fit these design principles, I will tell

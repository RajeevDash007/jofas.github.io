        Software engineer and freelancer. In love with the craft.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        In the summer of 2015 I wrote my first program (a Windows Forms app
        written in VB.NET, believe it or not). Over the course of that fateful
        summer I quickly became so deeply enamored with programming that I made
        it my profession.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        Since then I've successfully attained two higher education degrees in
        computing, lived in two countries, became a freelancer and open source
        contributor, created and maintained a microservice application with over
        seventy thousand lines of code all by myself, programmed supercomputers
        including a neuromorphic one with over one million cores (SpiNNaker),
        tried to teach machines how to see and how to conservatively predict
        whether a loan request is likely to default, learned a lot, failed many
        times and had the time of my life doing it all.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        This wesite serves as an introduction to myself, my work and the values
        it embodies.
        If you like what you see and think I could help you achive your
        ambitions, don't hesitate to

          multi-cloud? Which 3rd-party vendors or open source technologies fit
          best? Together we will figure that out. We will deconstruct your
          problem using Domain Driven Design and create a scalable and
          maintainable application for you.

          A maintainable software project that will run for a long time may
          start with a good, domain-driven architecture. But in the end, it's
          about the implementation. Let's make the internet a tiny bit better by
          writing well-tested and easy-to-read code to prevent the next big data
          leak.

          High performance and high availability computing is fun.
          Unfortunately, distributed systems are still very complex.
          It's hard to figure out communication, synchronization and fault
          tolerance.

          The idea of teaching computers how to solve complex tasks from data is
          very alluring and shows promising results.
          Having experience with supervised machine learning and conformal
          prediction on real-world data sets, I'd love to teach computers to make
          descisions based on your data.

      <h1>Core Values</h1>

        Software engineering is an idealistic endeavor.
        I became a freelancer, partly because I didn't want to compromise on
        what I think software should be.
        To create synergies and subsequently an environment that fosters
        collaboration and creativity, core values must match.

          Bugs in production are annoying and potentially dangerous.
          Mistakes should be caught as early in the development cycle as
          possible.
          Not only to prevent security issues, but also from the standpoint of
          cost.
          Two days spent on a decent test suite today has the potential of
          saving a lot of time and money tomorrow.

        <p class="pr-2 self-center">
          Software engineering has a lot to do with gut feeling.
          Sometimes you find ideas along the way that feel like they have the
          potential of creating something amazing.
          Instead of rigidly focusing on the backlog, I believe these ideas
          have to be explored immediately.
          I grant myself the freedom to do so.

          Deleting code is better than writing it.
          Feature creep and entropy result in software that dies before it
          should, a very costly event.
          I apply teachings from the Extreme Programming and UNIX philosophies
          to my work.
          My focus lies on creating lean, extensible, decoupled and long-living
          software.
          If I think a feature does not fit these design principles, I will tell
          you so and I expect you to be open to negotiation.

        <p class="pr-2 self-center">
          I don't think code that is hacked together by a sleep-deprived
          individual at 2am, right before a deadline is ever ready for
          production.
          Deadlines are artificial constructs.
          Estimates are faulty and seldom correct.
          A billion dollar industry has evolved to solve these problems that
          really aren't problems but just paper tigers.
          I refuse to partake in this hoax as much as I can, focusing on my
          work, on doing it the right way, rather than getting caught up in
          this wasteful game.

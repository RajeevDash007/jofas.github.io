      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        Software engineer and freelancer. In love with the craft.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        In the summer of 2015 I wrote my first program (a Windows Forms app
        written in VB.NET, believe it or not). Over the course of that fateful
        summer I quickly became so deeply enamored with programming that I made
        it my profession.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        Since then I've successfully attained two higher education degrees in
        computing, lived in two countries, became a freelancer and open source
        contributor, created and maintained a microservice application with over
        seventy thousand lines of code all by myself, programmed supercomputers
        including a neuromorphic one with over one million cores (SpiNNaker),
        tried to teach machines how to see and how to conservatively predict
        whether a loan request is likely to default, learned a lot, failed many
        times and had the time of my life doing it all.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        This wesite serves as an introduction to myself, my work and the values
        it embodies.

        ambitions, don't hesitate to

          Microservices or a monolith? On-premises, cloud, hybrid or
          multi-cloud? Which 3rd-party vendors or open source technologies fit
          best? Together we will figure that out. We will deconstruct your
          problem using Domain Driven Design and create a scalable and
          maintainable application for you.

          A maintainable software project that will run for a long time may
          start with a good, domain-driven architecture. But in the end, it's
          about the implementation. Let's make the internet a tiny bit better by
          writing well-tested and easy-to-read code to prevent the next big data
          leak.

          High performance and high availability computing is fun.
          Unfortunately, distributed systems are still very complex.
          It's hard to figure out communication, synchronization and fault
          tolerance.
          Together we will scale up your system while keeping track of all the
          moving parts.

          The idea of teaching computers how to solve complex tasks from data is
          very alluring and shows promising results.
          Having experience with supervised machine learning and conformal
          prediction on real-world data sets, I'd love to teach computers to make
          descisions based on your data.

          In the end, software is all about people.
          And most people interact with computers through a graphical user
          interface.

          can help you get your Flutter app off the ground and reach your
          clients on every device.

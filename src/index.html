        About
      </h1>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        In the summer of 2016 I wrote my first program (a Windows Forms app
        written in VB.NET, believe it or not).
        Quickly afterwards I became so enamored with programming that I made
        it my profession.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        Since then I've successfully attained two higher education degrees in
        computing, lived in two countries, became a FLOSS contributor,
        created and maintained a microservice application with over seventy
        thousand lines of code all by myself, programmed supercomputers
        including a neuromorphic one with over one million cores
        (<a class="underline" href="http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/" target="_blank">SpiNNaker</a>)
        and tried to
        <a class="underline" href="static/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">teach machines how to see</a>
        and
        <a class="underline" href="static/cp_for_loan_approval_prediction.pdf" target="_blank">how
          to conservatively predict whether a loan request is likely to default.</a>
        I learned a lot, failed many times and had the time of my life doing it
        all.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center paragraph-padding">
        After graduating in the fall of 2020 I became a freelancing software
        engineer, because I wanted to explore and experience the process of
        developing software to the fullest.
        Having had the priviledge of witnessing true masters of the craft first
        hand during my studies, learning from them and seeing what they are
        able to do, I wanted to be able to do the same.
        Therefore I'm trying my best every day to develop simple, well-tested,
        secure and useful software.

          Software engineering has a lot to do with gut feeling.
          Sometimes you find ideas along the way that feel like they have the
          potential of creating something amazing.
          Instead of rigidly focusing on the backlog, I believe these ideas

          Deleting code is better than writing it.

          should, a very costly event.
          I apply teachings from the Extreme Programming, UNIX and TDD
          philosophies to my work.
          My focus lies on creating lean, extensible, decoupled and long-living
          software.
          If I think a feature does not fit these design principles, I will tell

          Programming is the art of expressing computation for a computer to
          execute.
          Software engineering is the art of enabling other engineers to
          understand, use, change and extend a program.
          To me, this means that simple software that can be understood by many
          people is better than complex software only the author can read, even
          though it might be faster, or achieves the same in less lines of code.
          I'm striving to find the simplest possible solution by (I) using the
          right level of abstraction, (II) applying divide and conquer to
          sensibly structure a problem into more manageable sub-problems and
          (III) by developing a self-explanatory and consistent API.

          As a freelancer, you have several options when it comes to making
          your taxes and other business needs, like invoicing or hour tracking.
          None fit my needs, so I created a free bare-metal tool where you have
          full control over your data.
          The best part?
          You don't even have to leave your terminal.

          In short, I ferment pretty much everything I can lay my hands on.
          I even started making my own natural cheese recently.
          But my biggest pride is my sourdough.
          There is no greater joy than eating a slice of freshly made sourdough
          bread.
          Or pizza.
          Or brioche.
          Next I'd like to get more into alcoholic drinks like beer or mead
          and the really weird stuff (I have my eyes set on garum made from

          It all started 2020 during the first wave of COVID-19.
          Because traveling abroad was virtually impossible due to quarantine
          measurements, a couple of friends decided to spend a three day weekend
          holiday trip exploring the countryside of the Bergisches Land, our
          birthland.
          I joined and instantly fell in love with backpacking.
          Since then I did a few trips through Germany and the Scottish
          Highlands.
          The longest hike I did so far was a hundred miles from Fort William to
          Aviemore in seven days.
          My goal is to one day walk a two thousand mile trail.

          Few sports combine strength, speed and overall athleticism in such
          an aesthetic and rewarding way.
          A friend has introduced me to strength training in 2020.
          He basically tricked me, telling me we'd go to the gym to play
          squash.
          We arrived thirty minutes early, so he dragged me down to the vaults
          and put me in front of the squat rack.
          I was sore for two weeks.
          Once I could walk again I got a gym membership right away and
          started to go on a regular basis.
